# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe with AI (vs CPU)

This is a fully working code ( Android App ) that can be played PvP or against UNBEATABLE AI.

main files include:

**  Board.java --         This file contains working of Tic Tac Toe Board.
**GameMechanics.java --   It defines game mechanics like conditions when cpu or player wins.
**  AI_revised --         This file contains code for unbetable AI and How it chooses best move , based on minimax Algorithm.
                          *AI revised because it is revised as the first AI that I created didn't prove to be of much use.*

Feel Free to share any improvements or suggestions.
